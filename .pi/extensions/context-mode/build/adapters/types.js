/**
 * adapters/types — Platform adapter interface for multi-platform hook support.
 *
 * Defines the contract that each platform adapter must implement.
 * Three paradigms exist across supported platforms:
 *   A) JSON stdin/stdout — Claude Code, Gemini CLI, VS Code Copilot, Copilot CLI, Cursor
 *   B) TS Plugin Functions — OpenCode
 *   C) MCP-only (no hooks) — Codex CLI
 *
 * The MCP server layer is 100% portable and needs no adapter.
 * Only the hook layer requires platform-specific adapters.
